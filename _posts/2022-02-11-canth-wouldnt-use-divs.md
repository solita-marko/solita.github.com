# Minna Canth wouldn't use DIV's - HTML semantics and other tips to improve accessibility

>**Technological Advisory** <br> This blog article do not contain Hardcore tech stuff, but more of basic quidelines that are too often forgotten.

Now when Finlands early year holiday season is ongoing, Runeberg Day, Valentines Day and Laskiainen are still on sight and our stomachs should be full of chocolate, tart and buns, we might have enough strength to take a look into a much less recognised holiday, Minna Canths Day and celebration for **equality**. 

Nowadays when talking about Canth the first thing that might come in people's minds are jokes about her surname pronunciation. Or if you know your history, it might be the *feminism* which might be the topic she is best known. She is also known as a fighter on behalf of labourers and fight against the poverty and oppression. And that's why we are celebrating equality every year on Minna Canths birthday. 

But wait, isn't this a *DEV-blog*? So why are we talking about history and socio-politcs? In todays digitalised world, and when thinking equality it must include the Internet and all its services. When we are moving our society from a brick and mortar places in to the Web and digitalizing our common and every day services, we can't forget various user groups that comes with different characteristics and disabilities and how accessible the services are.
## Why is it important? 
You should compare Web accessibility to accessibility of buildings. You shouldn't build a bank or a hospital without a wheelchair ramp, or a high apartment building without an elevator, or a door which would be too narrow to pass. In the same manner you should think how accessible published apps' or site' are for its users.

## How to make accessible: Basics
### Step 1. Get your HTML-semantics together
#### Prologue
In late years of last century the UI development scene got a new tool and that tool was called `<table>`. Table-elements enabled two-dimensional layouts and aligning elements more easily side-by-side. In a following years tables got quickly over used and that led the Web UI-development into a *Table Hell*. After all, the solution wasn't optimal. Page semantics and the flow of the page weren’t great and so some smart people were *"Hey, we really should do something about this"*. Then some years passed and eventually we found a *One Element to rule them all*, the All mighty `<div>`.

Oh well, in the end we all are humans and we do not learn from our mistakes, so one `<div>` led to another `<div>` and eventually we found ourselves from this familiar and warm place called a *DIV Hell*. After years of DIV abuse we eventually noticed that we had given a special meaning for it and this was neither a good solution.

*NOTE: Authors are strongly encouraged to view the <b>div element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable</b>. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.*

*A Quote from [HTML Spec, about DIV-element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-div-element)*.<br>
The Great escape from the DIV Hell hasn't been so rapid that you might think, and if you look closely enough, you might find some remainings of DIV Hell from the darkest parts of your code base. But I think, finally we have decided to do something about it. Maybe all thanks goes to Accessibility directive and the fear of EU inspectors. <small>Author note: Author do not know for sure, does they even exists?</small> But in recent years something has really changed. We have more and more started to use a proper elements to describe page contents and it really isn't all about accessibility, it's also about a good practices. So here is couple small tips that might have a very big impact in your app's accessibility and practices.
#### Quick Tips to improve your HTML
1. Most of cases you don't have any reason why to use DIV-element. See some further [list of elements from a MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
2. Check that you use [headings correctly. Example tecniques in a WCAG 2.1 docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130.html) and see that your headings are in correct order in your page.
3. Check that your links are described and avoid `<a href="">(link)<a/>` *(We know that it's a link)*. So when doing anchor-links you should always define the content inside the tag so users, especially those who use screen readers, would know what the link contains.
4. Check your focus! See that all your elements, that has some content or are interactable, are focusable. Also pay attention how your app's "focus flow" works, and which order the elements will be focused. 
5. Use *alternative text* and *ARIA*, but don't over use or abuse them (Some ARIA-attributes are not needed, cause often good HTML semantics are enough). Remember to offer a good *alt-text* for images which describes it. In a good use alt-text is descriptive and it benefits user , if it don't just leave it empty. Why empty? Cause if the image has no meaning and is only decorative image, screen-readers are ping it. If you don't do so, you might put your users in a situation where they have to listen repeatedly *"Image, Image, Image..."*  (in a case of `<img alt="Image" />`).
```tsx
{/* Nope */}
<img src={srcOfDecorativeImg} alt="This is decorative image" />

{/* Yes */}
<img src={srcOfDecorativeImg} alt="" />

{/* Yes */}
<img src={srcOfImporantImage} alt="Alt text should tell you some necessary information that image or figure offers" />
```


### Step 2. Content creators are gods of your code
When building user interfaces as an artisan work, it's much more easier to effect what kind of structure your page layout contains, but when implementing a solutions in example on top of some CMS it is much more complexed to do a good and flexible solution where neither accessibility or the creators freedom suffers. 
<br> Quite often in this kind of cases you build a skeleton and a various components (to building blocks) that you or someone else has designed and content creator ties them together as a content. So in the end the final product is as good as content creator makes it. 
![](/img/equality-accessibility/programmer-creator.jpeg)
*Meme generated by Imgflip.com*
In this kind of situations you might describe content creator as a "god" of your code. And because gods are usually fallible, you might want to guide your content creators in a correct direction. So without educating the content creators it's almost impossible to have a good accessibility. I recommend that you should  share at least some of your accessibility secrets and help creators to understand and avoid unnecessarily complicated language, called jargon.

### Step 3. Colours & Contrast & Fonts
Maybe the most visible parts when regarding accessibility are colours and contrast. In Finland there are about 55 000 citizen who are having a poor eyesight or a visual impairment. As a developer you might not always be able to affect what colours are used in design or in a brand. It doesn't mean you shouldn't rise a questions about the design. The Easiest way to check your UI's contrasts are display UI only black and white mode so you are able to see better what are the color contrasts and is it good enough to spot all the details. You can also use online contrast ratio checkers in example [contrast-ratio.com](https://contrast-ratio.com/) or [WebAims contrast checker](https://Webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Further reading about [contrast ratio in WCAG specfication](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

Other visible part is of course fonts. [WebAim site tells us that there is not a best typeface or font in accessibility matter](https://Webaim.org/techniques/fonts/). The most important characteristics of fonts are that it shape should be quite simple and it should avoid all over-complex shapes. Characters shouldn't be too similar, in example `C` and `O` or `S` and `5` should have enough dissimilarities so letters can't be mixed up. Also when talking Web technologies you should definitely use dynamic or computed sizes when defining your app's styles. [A Good definition about different font-size values in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size#description). Common and quite safe choices to fonts are: Sans-serif; Tahoma, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial. Serif fonts; Times New Roman and Gerogia and Slab-serif; Arvo and Rockwell.

### Step 4. Dynamic content

Usually all static content is quite accessible but when considering modern Web development we tend to use technologies that dynamically updates content and for assistive technologies it's quite hard to keep up what are updated. That's why there's **ARIA live regions**. As a developer with live regions you are able to announce either politely or assertively, to the user if some content has changed.

Especially in a SPA world where the page won't refresh when content or a page context changes it's important to inform this kind of events to screen readers by changing your page title. This tells that the context has changed and end user gets notified about the change. 
```tsx
<head>
  <title>Dynamic title can change</title>
</head>
<body>
  <main aria-live="polite" role="region">
    <p>Dynamic content, can be changed</p>
  </main>
</body>
```

In a addition there can be found lot of instruvtions from other sources. In example Saavutettavuusmalli sub site of City of Helsinki offers [a good overview in PDF-format, how to handle dynamic content changes](https://saavutettavuusmalli.hel.fi/content/uploads/2021/06/Helsinki-Accessibility-Model-SPA-Notes.pdf).
#### Do I have to start from a scratch? - No
Using native HTML-elements are a good way to go, but usually not suitable in your app. There can be found a lot of component libraries and design systems that are designed in accessibility first. Here is a few examples for React development (list is not in any specific order):
#### Few accessible component libraries for React
- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/)
- [Adobe's React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/) 
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) 
- [HDS, Helsinki Design System](https://hds.hel.fi/)

## The End is near
This post didn't take a deep dive into technical side of accessibility practises, it would be topic for another post. I feel that we could improve and do the all basic stuff a bit better, or maybe it's just me. 

The List of basic stuff related accessibility techniques is quite long and so is the list of criteria's to meet WCAG's AAA-level. ([quick reference to WCAG 2.1 requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/), [Longer, W3C Recommendation document fo WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)) Usually you can't apply all of the requirement into your site, cause rarely as a developer you are lucky enough to get to work with all those technologies in a one project. 

I challenge every developer and designer, who works with UI's to test a screen reader at least once. To get objective experience you should turn off your display and try to navigate only using your keyboard via audio clues given by screen reader. It would also be good that you wouldn't know the tested page, so you couldn't have memorised the page structure beforehand. 

Here is some common screen readers to listed:
- Apple's Voice over that comes built in OS X and iOS [Guide how to use VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1124.html)
- [NVA (for Windows) site](https://www.nvaccess.org/)
- [Guide how to use Google Talkback (for Android)](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100?hl=en)

Additionally I give kudos for every right handed designer and developer who has tested their work (mobile app / page) with their *left hand*.
